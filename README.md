# ttt-rearm

Use re-arm script to add more weapons to maps.

## Features

This is a modified version of the [TTT Rearming Base](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2601478453) addon because it has not been updated to fix issues with TTT2 compatibility.

This is a modified version of a script included in TTT used to run rearm scripts generated by the
[weapon placer](url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=119928922) addon.

## Compatibility
There should be no issues with other addons. This is compatible with both TTT and TTT2.

Re-arming Scripts:

- [[TTT] Map Weapons Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2615356912) - Adds more weapons to over 100 maps!

## ConVars

- `ttt_rearm_enabled` (def: 1) - Whether or not re-arm is enabled.

## Server Info

Add it to your server by following this guide: http://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Server/Workshop

**Developer Info**

If you would like to create a re-arm script that can be uploaded to the workshop, simply rename the re-arm script's extension from `.txt` to `.lua` and place it in `lua/maps/`.

For example, if you have a re-arm script called `ttt_glacier_ttt.txt`, rename it to `ttt_glacier_ttt.lua` and place it in `lua/maps/ttt_glacier_ttt.lua`

The whole source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/gmod-workshop/ttt-rearm), feel free to contribute. The original addon was taken from [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2601478453) (but modified extensively!). I agree to remove this item if the Author or Valve wishes to.
